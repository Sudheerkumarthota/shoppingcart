# Shoppingcart
Create a shopping cart application.


Create a shopping cart application where:

User should be able to see list of items.
User should be able select from the list of items and add them to the cart.
User should be able to remove/add/modify the items from the cart.
Cart details should be persisted to DB (MySQL preferred)
System should be able to generate the invoice for the cart when user checks out.
Same item added twice should not show two different entries but should add to the quantity.
 
Application should be a REST application with Spring BOOT and any of the ORM tools.
DB design should be done considering all possible data points.
Each of the above-mentioned functionalities should have a REST endpoint. No UI development is expected.
Junit test cases will be an added advantage.
